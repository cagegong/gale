1
00:00:00,425 --> 00:00:02,626
瞧,Gary!
Look, Gary!

2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:06,033
那个警察正朝你挥手呢.
That policeman's waving to you.

3
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:08,593
他想要你停下来.
He wants you to stop.

4
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:12,455
你认为你现在是在哪儿?
Where do you think you are?

5
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:14,702
在赛车道上吗?
On a race track?

6
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:20,219
你刚才一定是以每小时70英里的速度开车.
You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,706
我不可能开得那么快的.
I can't have been.

8
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:27,115
我是以每小时80英里的速度超过你的.
I was doing eighty when I overtook you.

9
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:30,506
难道你没看见限速牌吗?
Didn't you see the speed limit?

10
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:33,767
我恐怕我没有看见,警官.
I'm afraid I didn't, officer.

11
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:36,751
我一定思想开小差了.
I must have been dreaming.

12
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:39,719
警官,他思想没有开小差.
He wasn't dreaming, officer.

13
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:44,768
我刚才正告诉他开慢点.
I was telling him to drive slowly.

14
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:48,045
所以我才没看见那牌子.
That's why I didn't see the sign.

15
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:51,321
让我看一看你的驾驶执照.
Let me see your driving licence.

16
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:54,590
这次我就不罚你款了.
I won't charge you this time.

17
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:57,886
但你最好不要再犯.
But you'd better not do it again!

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,464
谢谢您.我以后一定会多加注意.
Thank you. I'll certainly be more careful.

19
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,947
Gary,我刚才叫你开慢点吧.
I told you to drive slowly, Gary.

20
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:11,672
你总是叫我开慢点,亲爱的.
You always tell me to drive slowly, darling.

21
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:17,670
Well,下次你最听从我的劝告!
Well, next time you'd better take my advice!
