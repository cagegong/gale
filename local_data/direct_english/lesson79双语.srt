1
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:09,906
所以你的计划是什么, Dean? 
So what's your plan,Dean?

2
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,936
我的意思是, 在你实习结束后?
I mean,after your internship?

3
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:14,516
我完成学业.
I finish school.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,618
完成学业后, 我寻找一份工作.
After school,I look for a job.

5
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:19,892
以你的资历, 
With your qualifications,

6
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:21,824
你不会有什么大问题的.
you won't have much of a problem.

7
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,260
我希望那是真的.
I wish that were true.

8
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:26,939
很多有资格的人找不到工作.
Lots of qualified people can't get work.

9
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:31,005
因为企业雇不起人吗?
Because businesses can't afford to hire people?

10
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:32,226
那是他们所说的.
That's what they say.

11
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:34,373
尤其带上福利.
Especially with benefits.

12
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:37,287
所以我可能不会得到一份工作  很长一段时间里.
So I may not get a job for a long time.

13
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:39,160
如果我不能得到一份工作.
And if I can't get a job,

14
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:42,150
失业率必定是过高了.
unemployment must be too high.

15
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:45,853
当然, 我仍然必须还清我的学生贷款.
Of course,I still have to pay off my student loans.

16
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:48,459
你必须自己支付大学的费用吗?
You have to pay for university yourself?

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,969
政府不给你补贴吗?
Doesn't the government subsidize you?

18
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:54,230
不多. 你大多得靠自己.
Not much.You're pretty much on your own.

19
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:59,431
多有趣啊 报纸头条开始影响你的生活了.
Funny how the newspaper headlines start to affect your life.

20
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:02,152
失业, 通货膨胀...
Unemployment,inflation....

21
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:06,469
Well 那不是很令人愉快, 是吗?
Well that's not very cheerful,is it?

22
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:11,609
要是体育版更好一些该多好!
