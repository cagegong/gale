Will you get a new intern?
<k></k>

I think we should just hire him when he graduates.
<k></k>

A portable CD player.

Oh, is that what we chipped in for? Great.
<k></k>

9
I have something else.
<k></k>

10
What is it?
<k></k>

11
A soccer ball. From Kevin and me.
<k></k>

12
Oh Dean will like that.
<k></k>

13
He'll come to his senses some day.
<k></k>

14
Jarmusch, if I gain one ounce from this cake, I will kill you .
<k></k>

15
They're right behind us.
<k></k>

16
Kevin. You can't afford to take us to this restaurant.
<k></k>

17
For a friend like you, Dean?
<k></k>

<k></k>

19
Surprise!
