2
I want to tell you a true story.
<k></k>

3
It happened to a friend of mine a year ago.
<k></k>

4
While my friend, George, was reading in bed, two thieves climbed into his kitchen.
<k></k>

5
After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room.
<k></k>

6
It was very dark, so they turned on a torch.
<k></k>

7
Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them.
<k></k>

8
What's up? What's up?' someone called.
<k></k>

9
The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could.
<k></k>

10
George heard the noise and came downstairs quickly.
<k></k>

11
He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone.
<k></k>

12
The thieves had already gone.
<k></k>

13
But George's parrot, Henry, was still there.
<k></k>

14
What's up, George?' he called.
<k></k>

15
Nothing, Henry,' George said and smiled.
<k></k>

16
Go back to sleep.'
