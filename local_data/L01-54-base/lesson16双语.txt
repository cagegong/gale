Dean, have you got a moment?
<k></k>

2
Sure. I'm on my way home.
<k></k>

3
I'm working on a scheme to attract younger customers.
<k></k>

4
To the restaurant?
<k></k>

5
Yes.
<k></k>

6
"Youth Market Trends in the Dining Industry".
<k></k>

7
I beg your pardon?
<k></k>

8
My research last semester was on this topic.
<k></k>

9
Do go on.
<k></k>

10
Well, in general, younger customers prefer casual dining.
<k></k>

11
Yes.
<k></k>

12
They like finger food.
<k></k>

13
In fact, they often order appetizers.
<k></k>

14
In the bar, they prefer beer and wine to hard liquor.
<k></k>

15
Is that information useful?
<k></k>

16
Absolutely. Let me ask you a question.
<k></k>

17
Do they prefer large portions?
<k></k>

18
I mean, is that important?
<k></k>

19
Sure. They like large portions,
<k></k>

20
but they prefer lower prices.
<k></k>

21
After all, they're not making much money yet!
<k></k>

22
Is that the voice of experience, Dean?
<k></k>

23
Highly researched, of course.
<k></k>
