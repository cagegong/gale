Are you doing the football pools, Brain?
<k></k>

2
Yes, I've nearly finished, Julie.
<k></k>

3
I'm sure we'll win something this week.
<k></k>

4
You always say that, but we never win anything!
<k></k>

5
What will you do if you win a lot of money?
<k></k>

6
If I win a lot of money I'll buy you a mink coat!
<k></k>

7
I don't want a mink coat!
<k></k>

8
I want to see the world.
<k></k>

9
All right. If we win a lot of money,
<k></k>

10
We'll travel round the world and we'll stay at the best hotels.
<k></k>

11
Then we'll return home and buy a big house in the country.
<k></k>

12
We'll have a beautiful garden and ...
<k></k>

13
But if we spend all that money we'll be poor again.
<k></k>

14
What'll we do then?
<k></k>

15
If we spend all the money, we'll try and win the football pools again.
<k></k>

16
It's a pleasant dream but everything depends on 'if'!
<k></k>
