Which books did you buy?
<k></k>

The books which are on the counter.
<k></k>

Did you serve this gentleman half an hour ago, Caroline?

He says he's the man who bought these books.

The man who I served was wearing a hat.
<k></k>

Have you got a hat, sir? Yes, I have.
<k></k>

12
Would you put it on, please?
<k></k>

13
All right.
<k></k>

14
Is this the man that you served, Caroline?
<k></k>
