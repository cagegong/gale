So tell me,Simon,how did you wind up here, a restaurant manager in Boston?

4
Ah!Well,that's a bit of a puzzle to me,as well.

5
Was your training in restaurants?

6
Oh no!After primary and secondary schools I went to university.

7
Manchester.Modern languages.

8
That's a lot of tests.

9
Oh yes,I passed all kinds of exams.

10
I was never any good at taking tests.

11
I barely got through elementary school.

12
High school was worse.

13
And it was years before I went to college.

14
And I didn't do very well there either,I'm afraid.

15
Oh,I did well,but there was something missing.

16
At the end of the day,I wanted experience that was...

17
Hands-on.

19
Find out the way it works in the real world.

20
Yes.

So you got a job!

22
NO.I went back to business school for management studies.

23
More tests!
