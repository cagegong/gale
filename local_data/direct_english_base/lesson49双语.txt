Good afternoon. Do you speak English?
<k></k>

2
Wonderful.
<k></k>

3
I'm calling from the United States.
<k></k>

4
I'd like to speak with Milos Hermann, please.
<k></k>

5
Yes. Thank you.
<k></k>

6
Hello Milos!
<k></k>

7
This is Anne Holland, from the Sheraton Boston.
<k></k>

8
Yes, me too. How are you?
<k></k>

9
I'm very well, thank you.
<k></k>

10
Excuse me?
<k></k>

11
No, I'm calling from Boston.
<k></k>

12
We'll have our arrival dates very soon.
<k></k>

13
Milos, I wonder if there's an interesting theatre or club we can go to while we're in Prague.
<k></k>

14
We can? Excellent.
<k></k>

15
Good idea. We can lunch at the hotel restaurant by all means,
<k></k>

16
but then let's get into town for drinks and dinner.
<k></k>

17
Milos, tell me, is there a hair salon at the hotel?
<k></k>

18
I see Hm.
<k></k>

19
My hair doesn't travel very well.
<k></k>

20
Yeah, hat shop is a solution...
<k></k>

21
No, I don't think a wig is necessary.
<k></k>

22
OK then.
<k></k>

23
Yes. I look forward to it. Good bye.
<k></k>

24
Maybe I do need a wig.
<k></k>
