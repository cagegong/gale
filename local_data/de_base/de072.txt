Hey, Carl. Here's a postcard from Nina.
<k></k>

2
From Prague.
<k></k>

3
I saw Nina here two minutes ago.
<k></k>

4
Oh, they've been back for days.
<k></k>

5
She writes,"I miss my baby, but I'm glad I'm here."
<k></k>

6
What else?
<k></k>

7
She says they've just arrived.
<k></k>

8
Boy, this took a long time to get here.
<k></k>

9
She says it's beautiful and she's already in love with the city.
<k></k>

10
I've never been.
<k></k>

11
Me, neither. She makes it sound great.
<k></k>

12
She said they had done a lot of walking.
<k></k>

13
And she was going to do a lot more walking when she got back.
<k></k>

14
Let's see. It's a funny thing about travel.
<k></k>

15
What?
<k></k>

16
People go all that way, to a completely new place.
<k></k>

17
They see their lives from a new perspective,
<k></k>

18
-you know?   -Sure
<k></k>

19
And they make decisions...
<k></k>

20
like they're going to do a lot more walking.
<k></k>

21
Travel's a funny thing.
<k></k>

22
Have a good trip, sir.
<k></k>
