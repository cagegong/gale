5
Bye.

6
George?

7
Yeah?

8
What was that all about?

9
Oh!Sharon just wants me to arrange some transportation for a guest.

10
Ah,that's not your job.

11
She just wants me to help her occasionally.

12
She wants you to help her occasionally?

13
Well...

14
George,I don't think so.

15
I need you 100% in this office.

16
Right.

17
Next time,would you please tell her that you have your own work to do?

18
I'd better do that now.

19
But it won't be easy coming up against her southern charm.

20
George,why don't you just use that northern charm of yours?
