Is that you, John?
<k></k>

2
Yes, speaking.
<k></k>

3
Tell Mary we'll be late for dinner this evening.
<k></k>

4
I'm afraid I don't understand.
<k></k>

5
Hasn't Mary told you?
<k></k>

6
She invited Charlotte and me to dinner this evening.
<k></k>

7
I said I would be at your house at six o'clock,
<k></k>

8
but the boss wants me to do some extra work.
<k></k>

9
I'll have to stay at the office.
<k></k>

10
I don't know when I'll finish.
<k></k>

11
Oh, and by the way, my wife wants to know if Mary needs any help.
<k></k>

12
I don't know what you're talking about.
<k></k>

13
That is John Smith, isn't it?
<k></k>

14
Yes, I'm John Smith.
<k></k>

15
You are John Smith, the engineer, aren't you?
<k></k>

16
That's right.
<k></k>

17
You work for the Overseas Engineering Company, don't you?
<k></k>

18
No, I don't. I'm John Smith the telephone engineer
<k></k>

19
and I'm repairing your telephone line.
<k></k>
