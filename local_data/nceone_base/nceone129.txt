Look, Gary!
<k></k>

2
That policeman's waving to you.
<k></k>

3
He wants you to stop.
<k></k>

4
Where do you think you are?
<k></k>

5
On a race track?
<k></k>

6
You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.
<k></k>

7
I can't have been.
<k></k>

8
I was doing eighty when I overtook you.
<k></k>

9
Didn't you see the speed limit?
<k></k>

10
I'm afraid I didn't, officer.
<k></k>

11
I must have been dreaming.
<k></k>

12
He wasn't dreaming, officer.
<k></k>

13
I was telling him to drive slowly.
<k></k>

14
That's why I didn't see the sign.
<k></k>

15
Let me see your driving licence.
<k></k>

16
I won't charge you this time.
<k></k>

17
But you'd better not do it again!
<k></k>

18
Thank you. I'll certainly be more careful.
<k></k>

19
I told you to drive slowly, Gary.
<k></k>

20
You always tell me to drive slowly, darling.
<k></k>

21
Well, next time you'd better take my advice!
<k></k>
