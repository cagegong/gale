You look tired,Simon.

2
Didn't you sleep well last night?

3
I had a very strange dream.

4
Yeah?

5
I went to Scotland to play golf.

6
That's not so strange.

7
But I played an amazing game.

8
After the first seventeen holes,

9
my score was seventeen.

10
Seventeen?

11
Seventeen.

12
That means you hit seventeen holes-in-one.

13
One after another.

14
I hit that ball.

15
It flew through the air,landed,

16
and rolled into the waiting cup.

17
That's a great dream.

18
I could do no wrong.

19
Until the eighteenth hole.

20
What happened?

21
It started fine.

22
I drove onto the green.

23
I was about three feet away from golfing history..

24
the lowest score ever.

25
Simon.What happened next?

26
Ninety-four putts.

27
That's no dream. That a nightmare.
