1
He was talking to Anne.
<k></k>

2
At first I thought he was so mean.
<k></k>

3
A real snob, you know?
<k></k>

4
He is not, though.
<k></k>

5
He said he barely got through school.
<k></k>

6
He told me he did really badly at university.
<k></k>

7
Well, he learned to run a company somewhere.
<k></k>

8
He makes a ton of money.
<k></k>

9
That's the thing.
<k></k>

10
He said he was bad at maths.
<k></k>

11
At what?
<k></k>

12
Maths.
<k></k>

13
You mean math?
<k></k>

14
We say maths.
<k></k>

15
You must mean all the different maths.
<k></k>

16
Because I mean the one basic math.
<k></k>

17
Whatever.
<k></k>

18
But Wendy, listen to this.
<k></k>

19
He told me making money is easy.
<k></k>

20
He said,"If I buy someting for one dollar, and sell it for two,
<k></k>

21
I make money from that one per cent difference."
<k></k>

22
One per cent? You mean a hundred per cent.
<k></k>

23
Right. The man can't figure a percentage to save his life.
<k></k>

24
Tell me about it.
<k></k>

25
You should see the tip he left me!
<k></k>
