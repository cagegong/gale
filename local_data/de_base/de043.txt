1
I used to roller skate all the time.
<k></k>

2
I loved it when I was little. Did you?
<k></k>

3
No. I went straight from my pram to a surfboard.
<k></k>

4
I used to live in the ocean.
<k></k>

5
No wheels required.
<k></k>

6
Well, you're the first surfing physicist I've ever met.
<k></k>

7
Oh, right.
<k></k>

8
Dean told you I used to be a physicist, didn't he?
<k></k>

9
Yes.
<k></k>

10
It's an interesting combination.
<k></k>

11
I like interesting combinations.
<k></k>

12
A surfing, bartending physicist is very interesting.
<k></k>

13
Elena told you.
<k></k>

14
Elena told me.
<k></k>

15
I'm sorry. I didn't mean any harm, Heather.
<k></k>

16
That's OK.
<k></k>

17
I like a man with a vivid imagination.
<k></k>

18
That's good.
<k></k>

19
I like someone with a sense of humor.
<k></k>

20
But why would you tell someone you were a physicist?
<k></k>

21
Well, I used to say I was a doctor.
<k></k>

22
You didn't.
<k></k>

23
But people asked me for medical advice.
<k></k>
