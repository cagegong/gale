George, would you mind taking care of this for me?
<k></k>

2
You did such a good job last time.
<k></k>

3
Sure. I'll do it as soon as I can.
<k></k>

4
Thanks ever so much. See you later.
<k></k>

5
Bye.
<k></k>

6
George?
<k></k>

7
Yeah?
<k></k>

8
What was that all about?
<k></k>

9
Oh! Sharon just wants me to arrange some transportation for a guest.
<k></k>

10
Ah, that's not your job.
<k></k>

11
She just wants me to help her occasionally.
<k></k>

12
She wants you to help her occasionally?
<k></k>

13
Well...
<k></k>

14
George, I don't think so.
<k></k>

15
I need you 100% in this office.
<k></k>

16
Right.
<k></k>

17
Next time, would you please tell her that you have your own work to do?
<k></k>

18
I'd better do that now.
<k></k>

19
But it won't be easy coming up against her southern charm.
<k></k>

20
George, why don't you just use that northern charm of yours?
<k></k>
