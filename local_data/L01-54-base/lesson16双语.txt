Dean, have you got a moment?

2
Sure. I'm on my way home.

3
I'm working on a scheme to attract younger customers.

4
To the restaurant?

5
Yes.

6
"Youth Market Trends in the Dining Industry".

7
I beg your pardon?

8
My research last semester was on this topic.

9
Do go on.

10
Well, in general, younger customers prefer casual dining.

11
Yes.

12
They like finger food.

13
In fact, they often order appetizers.

14
In the bar, they prefer beer and wine to hard liquor.

15
Is that information useful?

16
Absolutely. Let me ask you a question.

17
Do they prefer large portions?

18
I mean, is that important?

19
Sure. They like large portions,

20
but they prefer lower prices.

21
After all, they're not making much money yet!

22
Is that the voice of experience, Dean?

23
Highly researched, of course.
