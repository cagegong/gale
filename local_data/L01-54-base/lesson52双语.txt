<k></k>

2
Two and a half years.
<k></k>

3
Are you enjoying it?
<k></k>

4
Absolutely.
<k></k>

5
Boston's so small and charming and manageable after London.
<k></k>

6
It's a big city to me,after growing up in Bunkie,Louisiana.
<k></k>

7
I love the museums here,and art galleries.
<k></k>

8
And the beautiful stores.
<k></k>

9
And restaurants.
<k></k>

10
Well,you can't get my momma's hot cakes in Boston.
<k></k>

11
Ah,but Boston baked beans and lobster...
<k></k>

12
Right.
<k></k>

13
Isn't it a bit strange for you,living in Yankee country?
<k></k>

14
Maybe a little.
<k></k>

15
No stranger than your situation.
<k></k>

16
You didn't win either,remember?
<k></k>

17
True.
<k></k>

18
Have you noticed that Boston drivers are quite mad?
<k></k>

19
Oh I have.But I can live with that.
<k></k>

20
Do you know what I really don't like?
<k></k>

21
What?
<k></k>

22
The freezing winters.
<k></k>

23
Ah.
<k></k>

24
And they're forever going outside in the cold.
<k></k>

25
Hardy New Englanders,Sharon.
<k></k>

26
You'll have to get used to it.
<k></k>
