We've managed to control our costs, as you can see.
<k></k>

They're actually down 7%.
<k></k>

5
Not bad. But of course you're expected to do that.
<k></k>

And we've changed our advertising.
<k></k>

We think that's helped new business.
<k></k>

New business has grown 10% since last January.
<k></k>

Not bad.
<k></k>

With the industry in its current state, I venture to say it's quite good.
<k></k>

By all means.
<k></k>

15
Is there anything else I can answer for you then?
<k></k>

16
I've heard about the programs, Anne.
<k></k>

17
Employee groups, the marketing.
<k></k>

18
And I want to know who's responsible.
<k></k>

I see.
<k></k>

20
We have many other hotels, you know.
<k></k>
