So what was the weather like this time of year?

3
Hong Kong was better than here,I hope.

Why?Did it rain?

5
Wet and miserable.

6
Too bad.Hong Kong was hot.

7
I loved it.Some days it reached 85'.

8
Whew!Too hot for me.

9
It's not the heat.It's the humidity.

10
Hot and humidy?Yuck.

11
Oh,everything's air-conditioned,anyway.

12
One day,I went by boat to Macau,

13
and there was a fantastic thunderstorm on the water.

14
Where's Macau?

15
George,we have to get you a map.

16
Ah,it's just east of Hong Kong.

17
-West.  -Hm?

Macau is west of Hong Kong.
