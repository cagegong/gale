1
I like this television very much.
<k></k>

2
How much does it cost?
<k></k>

3
It's the most expensive model in the shop.
<k></k>

4
It costs five hundred pounds.
<k></k>

5
That's too expensive for us.
<k></k>

6
We can't afford all that money.
<k></k>

7
This model's less expensive than that one.
<k></k>

8
It's only three hundred pounds.
<k></k>

9
But, of course, it's not as good as the expensive one.
<k></k>

10
I don't like this model.
<k></k>

11
The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.
<k></k>

12
Can we buy it on instalments?
<k></k>

13
Of course. You can pay a deposit of thirty pounds,
<k></k>

14
and then fourteen pounds a month for three years.
<k></k>

15
Do you like it, dear?
<k></k>

16
I certainly do, but I don't like the price.
<k></k>

17
You always want the best, but we can't afford it.
<k></k>

18
Sometimes you think you're a millionaire!
<k></k>

19
Millionaires don't buy things on instalments!
<k></k>
