Simon, how long have you lived in Boston?

2
Two and a half years.

3
Are you enjoying it?

4
Absolutely.

5
Boston's so small and charming and manageable after London.

6
It's a big city to me,after growing up in Bunkie,Louisiana.

7
I love the museums here,and art galleries.

8
And the beautiful stores.

9
And restaurants.

10
Well,you can't get my momma's hot cakes in Boston.

11
Ah,but Boston baked beans and lobster...

12
Right.

13
Isn't it a bit strange for you,living in Yankee country?

14
Maybe a little.

15
No stranger than your situation.

16
You didn't win either,remember?

17
True.

18
Have you noticed that Boston drivers are quite mad?

19
Oh I have.But I can live with that.

20
Do you know what I really don't like?

21
What?

22
The freezing winters.

23
Ah.

24
And they're forever going outside in the cold.

25
Hardy New Englanders,Sharon.

26
You'll have to get used to it.
