1
Last week, my four-year-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party.
<k></k>

2
I decided to take her by train.
<k></k>

3
Sally was very excited because she had never travelled on a train before.
<k></k>

4
She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw.
<k></k>

5
Suddenly, a middle-aged lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally.
<k></k>

6
Hello, little girl,' she said.
<k></k>

7
Sally did not answer, but looked at her curiously.
<k></k>

8
The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat.
<k></k>

9
After the train had left the station,
<k></k>

10
the lady opened her handbag and took out her powder compact.
<k></k>

11
She then began to make up her face.
<k></k>

12
Why are you doing that?' Sally asked.
<k></k>

13
To make myself beautiful,' the lady answered.
<k></k>

14
She put away her compact and smiled kindly.
<k></k>

15
But you are still ugly,' Sally said.
<k></k>

16
Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed!
