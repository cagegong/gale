Good afternoon.
<k></k>

2
I believe that this house is for sale.
<k></k>

3
That's right.
<k></k>

4
May I have a look at it, please?
<k></k>

5
Yes, of course. Come in.
<k></k>

6
How long have you lived here?
<k></k>

7
I've live here for twenty years.
<k></k>

8
Twenty years!
<k></k>

9
That's a long time.
<k></k>

10
Yes, I've been here since 1976.
<k></k>

11
Then why do you want to sell it?
<k></k>

12
Because I've just retired.
<k></k>

13
I want to buy a small house in the country.
<k></k>

14
How much does this house cost?
<k></k>

15
Â£68, 500.
<k></k>

16
That's a lot of money.
<k></k>

17
It's worth every penny of it.
<k></k>

18
Well, I like the house,
<k></k>

19
but I can't decide yet.
<k></k>

20
My wife must see it first.
<k></k>

21
Women always have the last word.
<k></k>
