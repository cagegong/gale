1
I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods.
<k></k>

2
It is a famous beauty spot.
<k></k>

3
On Sundays, hundreds of people come from the city to see our town
<k></k>

4
and to walk through the woods.
<k></k>

5
Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy.
<k></k>

6
Litter baskets have been placed under the trees,
<k></k>

7
but people still throw their rubbish everywhere.
<k></k>

8
Last Wednesday, I went for a walk in the woods.
<k></k>

9
What I saw made me very sad.
<k></k>

10
I counted seven old cars and three old refrigerators.
<k></k>

11
The litter baskets were empty
<k></k>

12
and the ground was covered with pieces of paper, cigarette ends, old tyres,
<k></k>

13
empty bottles and rusty tins.
<k></k>

14
Among the rubbish, I found a sign which said,
<k></k>

15
Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted!'
<k></k>
