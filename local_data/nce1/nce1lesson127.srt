1
00:00:00,705 --> 00:00:05,214
Liz,你能认出那个女人吗?
Can you recognize that woman,Liz?

2
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:08,611
我想我认得出来,Kate.
I think I can, Kate.

3
00:00:08,643 --> 00:00:13,542
那一定是女演员Karen Marsh.
It must be Karen Marsh,the actress.

4
00:00:13,543 --> 00:00:15,462
我也这样想.
I thought so.

5
00:00:15,463 --> 00:00:18,384
她旁边的那个人是谁?
Who's that beside her?

6
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:22,427
一定是Conrad Reeves.
That must be Conrad Reeves.

7
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:25,612
Conrad Reeves,那个男演员吗?
Conrad Reeves, the actor?

8
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:27,424
不可能是.
It can't be.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,751
让我再看一看.
Let me have another look.

10
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:33,026
我想你是对的.
I think you're right!

11
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:36,784
他不是她的第3个丈夫吗?
Isn't he her third husband?

12
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:42,559
不,他一定是她的第4个或第5个丈夫.
No. He must be her fourth or fifth.

13
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:46,224
Karen Marsh看上去不显老嘛!
Doesn't Karen Marsh look old!

14
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,447
是的,谁说不是呢!
She does, doesn't she!

15
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:53,234
我从报上看到她是29岁,
I read she's twenty-nine,

16
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:56,984
但她一定至少有40岁了.
but she must be at least forty.

17
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:59,639
我肯定她是的.
I'm sure she is.

18
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:05,485
当我还是学生时,她就是个著名的演员了.
She was a famous actress When I was still at school.

19
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:10,210
那是好久以前的事了.是吗?
That was a long time ago, wasn't it?

20
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:13,062
不,没有那么久.
Not that long ago!

21
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:17,676
我自己现在还没29岁呢.

I'm not more than twenty-nine myself.
