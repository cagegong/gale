1
00:00:00,765 --> 00:00:05,030
我来煮点咖啡好吗,Jane?
Shall I make some coffee,Jane?

2
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:08,992
这是个好主意,Charlotte.
That's a good idea, Charlotte.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,909
咖啡好了,
It's ready.

4
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:14,747
你要放点奶吗?
Do you want any milk?

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,523
请稍加一点.
Just a little, please.

6
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:20,212
加些糖怎么样?
What about some sugar?

7
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:22,814
两茶匙行吗?
Two teaspoonfuls?

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,014
不,再少一些.
No, less than that.

9
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:30,529
请放一勺儿半.
One and a half teaspoonfuls, please.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,088
那对我足够了.
That's enough for me.

11
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:37,060
太好了.
That was very nice.

12
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:39,807
你要再来点吗?
Would you like some more?

13
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:42,570
好的,请再来一点.
Yes, please.

14
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:46,166
我还想抽枝烟.
I'd like a cigarette, too.

15
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:48,911
可以给我一枝吗?
May I have one?

16
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:51,011
当然可以.
Of course.

17
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:55,910
我想那个盒子里有一些.
I think there are a few in that box.

18
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:58,515
我恐怕盒子是空的.
I'm afraid it's empty.

19
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,086
真遗憾!
What a pity!

20
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:03,384
没关系.
It doesn't matter.

21
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:06,465
那就吃块饼干吧.
Have a biscuit instead.

22
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:10,500
多吃点,少抽点!
Eat more and smoke less!

23
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:13,500
这是极好的忠告啊!
That's very good advice!
