1
This is just what I needed.
<k></k>

2
It is a lovely park, isn't it?
<k></k>

3
So tell me, Simon, how did you wind up here, a restaurant manager in Boston?
<k></k>

4
Ah! Well, that's a bit of a puzzle to me, as well.
<k></k>

5
Was your training in restaurants?
<k></k>

6
Oh no! After primary and secondary schools I went to university.
<k></k>

7
Manchester. Modern languages.
<k></k>

8
That's a lot of tests.
<k></k>

9
Oh yes, I passed all kinds of exams.
<k></k>

10
I was never any good at taking tests.
<k></k>

11
I barely got through elementary school.
<k></k>

12
High school was worse.
<k></k>

13
And it was years before I went to college.
<k></k>

14
And I didn't do very well there either, I'm afraid.
<k></k>

15
Oh, I did well, but there was something missing.
<k></k>

16
At the end of the day, I wanted experience that was...
<k></k>

17
Hands-on.
<k></k>

18
Exactly.
<k></k>

19
Find out the way it works in the real world.
<k></k>

20
Yes.
<k></k>

21
So you got a job!
<k></k>

22
NO. I went back to business school for management studies.
<k></k>

23
More tests!
<k></k>
