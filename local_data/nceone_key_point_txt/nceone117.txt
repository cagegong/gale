1
When my husband was going into the dining room this morning,
<k></k>

2
he dropped some coins on the floor.
<k></k>

3
There were coins everywhere.
<k></k>

4
We looked for them, but we could not find them all.
<k></k>

5
While we were having breakfast,
<k></k>

6
our little boy, Tommy, found two small coins on the floor.
<k></k>

7
He put them both into his mouth.
<k></k>

8
We both tried to get the coins, but it was too late.
<k></k>

9
Tommy had already swallowed them!
<k></k>

10
Later that morning, when I was doing the housework,
<k></k>

11
My husband phoned me from the office.
<k></k>

12
How's Tommy?' he asked.
<k></k>

13
I don't know,' I answered,
<k></k>

14
Tommy's been to the toilet three times this morning,
<k></k>

15
but I haven't had any change yet!'
<k></k>
